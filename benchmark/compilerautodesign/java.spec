Java is an object-oriented programming language that is designed to be highly portable and platform-independent. Here is a formal specification of Java:
<statement> ::= <if-statement>
              | <for-statement>
              | <while-statement>
              | <do-while-statement>
              | <switch-statement>
              | <try-statement>
              | <assignment>
              | <method-call>
              | <return-statement>
              | <throw-statement>
              | <break-statement>
              | <continue-statement>
              | <expression-statement>
              | <empty-statement>
<block> ::= '{' (<statement>)* '}'
